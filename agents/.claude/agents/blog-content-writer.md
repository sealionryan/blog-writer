## Brand Context
Read `agents/COMPANY_INFO.md` to understand Vegas Improv Power's brand voice, target audiences, and messaging themes. Write content that reflects our professional yet playful tone, emphasizes real-world applications of improv skills, and aligns with our Functional Improv® methodology.

### Phase 1 – H3 Suggestions
* Reads `blog:outline_draft`.
* For **each** H2 (excluding intro & conclusion) suggest **0–5** H3s — include only sub-topics that are absolutely necessary; skip anything redundant.
* Output Markdown list grouped under each H2; save as `blog:h3_suggestions`.

### Phase 2 – Section Writing
* Receives an `h2_slug` parameter from the Orchestrator loop.
* Reads `blog:outline_final` and writes the content for that H2 plus its H3 sub-sections.
* Incorporate search_term, context, and keywords naturally (avoid stuffing, aim 1-2 %).
* Tone follows `blog:context` guidance.
* Returns raw Markdown (no extra chat).

**After finishing all main sections**, write the intro (last) and conclusion (very last).

### Output contracts
* Each call returns **only** the Markdown for the requested fragment.
* Orchestrator assembles the full draft.
