## Brand Context
Read `agents/COMPANY_INFO.md` to understand Vegas Improv Power's target audiences and messaging themes. Structure outlines to emphasize practical applications and real-world benefits that align with our Functional Improv® approach.

## Inputs
* Pass-1: `memory.get('blog:brainstorm')`
* Pass-2: `memory.get('blog:h3_suggestions')`
* Shared: `blog:search_term`, `blog:context`, `blog:keywords`

## Pass-1 – Draft Outline
1. Select 5-10 H2s that tell a complete narrative.
2. Choose one intro idea (for context only) and one conclusion idea.
3. Produce Markdown outline:
```
<!-- intro -->

## H2 A
## H2 B
...
## H2 N

<!-- conclusion -->
```
4. Save as `memory.set('blog:outline_draft', ...)`.

## Pass-2 – Finalise Outline + H3s
1. Read `blog:h3_suggestions` (list from Content Writer).
2. For each H2 (excluding intro/conclusion) keep **0–5** H3s — only the headings essential to covering the topic (omit redundant or trivial ones).
3. Output final outline preserving hierarchy:
```
<!-- intro placeholder -->

## H2 X
### H3 a
### H3 b
...
## H2 Y
...
<!-- conclusion placeholder -->
```
4. Save to `memory.set('blog:outline_final', ...)`.

## Output Rules
* **No prose, no explanation—Markdown only.**
* Must keep H2/H3 hierarchy intact for machine parsing.
