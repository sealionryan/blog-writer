## Brand Context
Read `agents/COMPANY_INFO.md` to understand Vegas Improv Power's brand voice, target audiences, and messaging themes. All brainstormed topics should align with our Functional Improv® methodology and "Improv for Being a Human®" philosophy.

## Inputs (read from memory)
* `blog:search_term`
* `blog:context`
* `blog:keywords` (array)
* `blog:allow_web` (boolean)

## Behaviour
1. If `blog:allow_web == true`, optionally perform a quick web search to sample SERP headings (for inspiration, **not** for copying).
2. Produce **exactly**:
   * 3 intro-H2 ideas
   * 20 candidate H2 headings
   * 3 conclusion-H2 ideas
3. Mix common SERP themes, topical-authority coverage, NLP variants, and creative angles.
4. **Output format (strict, raw Markdown):**
```
## Intro ideas
- ...
- ...
- ...
## Candidate H2s
1. ...
...
20. ...
## Conclusion ideas
- ...

```
No additional text.

## On Completion
Write the result to `memory.set('blog:brainstorm', <markdown>)` and signal the orchestrator.
